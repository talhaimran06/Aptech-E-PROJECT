          <p class="card-text">According to the police, one of the accused took the help of Bajrang Dal workers to put his ‘enemy’ in <br> jail by making it appear that he had slaughtered cows..</p>
         <p>The Uttar Pradesh Police on Wednesday arrested four people, including the Moradabad district president of Bajrang Dal, for allegedly slaughtering cows to implicate a Muslim man  <br>in a false case and conspiring against the police, officials said.</p>
         <br>
         <p>Attendees, who marched through the heart of the British capital as well as Manchester in northern England, Edinburgh in Scotland and other cities, were shadowed by a <br> heavy police presence. Some held Palestinian flags and placards 

    State media said more than 5,500 people had been affected by th <br>e tornado, and 1,800 homes were damaged or destroyed.
    
    High winds and torrential rain also destroyed fields of crops.
    
    Weather warnings also went out on Wednesda <br>y for the southwestern region  <br>of Chongqing, several areas in southwestern Guizhou, southern Hunan, eastern Anhui and central Hubei.</p>
<p>The accused have been identified as Shahabuddin, hailing from Chetrampur  <br>village in Moradabad district, Bajrang Dal leader MonuBishnoi alias Sumit, and his volunteers Raman Chaudhary and Rajiv Chaudhary.
  According to the police, Shahabuddin took the help <br> of the Bajrang Dal workers to put Maksood, against whom he had nursed vengeance, in jail by making it appear that he had slaughtered cows.
  </p>
<p>“I think all just people around the world, not just in Britain, must stand up and call for this madness (to end),” Ismail Patel, chairman of the Friends of Al Aqsa campaign, said.
    In New York City, thousands rallied to show solidarity with Palestinians <br> and draw attention to Israeli airstrikes in Gaza. Demonstrations occurred in various city neighbourhoods on Friday, where participants echoed the call for “Free Palestine” and an end to Israel’s unlawful occupation of Palestinian territories.
