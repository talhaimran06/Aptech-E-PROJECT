<p>And at least three New York nonprofit organizations are calling on donors <br> to help outfit those settlers with combat gear, <br> in a fundraising blitz funneling millions of tax-deductible dollars to the West Bank aggression
    By chipping into a “thermal drone matching campaign,” donors can help the Long Island- <br>based One Israel Fund buy remote-controlled aerial vehicles for settler militias. With a contribution to the American Friends of AteretCohanim’s “security projects,” they can equip settlers with accessories for their guns and tools to keep an eye on “Arab thugs” in occupied East Jerusalem. Donating to the Brooklyn-based Hebron Fund’s “Israel Is Under Attack” campaign helps expand one of Israel’s most extensive local surveillance networks. If New Yorkers contribute by the end of the year, they can write it off on their 2023 tax returns.
