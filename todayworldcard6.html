          <h5 class="card-title">Understanding a week of missile strikes across Middle East</h5>
          <p class="card-text">The past week has seen new rounds of violence across the Middle East, deepening fears of conflict spreading in an already unstable region.

            Here is a brief guide to what has happened - and where it might lead.
            
           <h6> <b>IRAN-PAKISTAN</b></h6>
            On Tuesday, Iran unexpectedly carried out a missile and drone attack on Pakistani territory. Iran said it was targeting an Iranian Sunni Muslim militant group, Jaish al-Adl, that has staged attacks inside Iran. Pakistan said two children were killed and swiftly hit back, launching missiles at Pakistani "terrorist hideouts" on Iran's side of the border. Iran said three women, two men and four children were killed.
            The flare-up has heightened tensions in a region already experiencing a multitude of crises. Although the area of the tit-for-tat strikes is far from the main theatres of fighting in the Middle East, the border is volatile and further incidents here could quickly escalate, for instance if Jaish al-Adl retaliates against Iran.
