            <h1>From risk to revolution: How AI can revive democracy</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="card-body">

          <p class="card-text">Members of industries and governments at the frontier of the latest technologies are meeting at Bletchley Park on November 1-2 to take part in Britain’s global AI Safety Summit.

            Safety is a familiar theme in technology policy: technology can offer opportunities for business, but poses risks to society. First with the internet, then social media, the role of government has been to contain the fallout from the generational technologies deployed by industry.
            
            Yet there is an alternative approach. AI could be the force behind a revolution in responsive, innovative public institutions – from  local libraries to international organizations, tackling some of the most complex global challenges. But to get there, the role of government must go beyond mere regulation and move towards the implementation of public AI systems.</p>
          <h2>AI can reinvigorate the democratic process</h2>
          <p>The United States, Sweden and France are recognizing AI does not have to be built to the blueprints of shareholders, but can and should be utilized by the public, for the public. While AI poses risks – potentially existential ones – it also offers opportunities to reverse decades of under-investment in public capacity while re-invigorating the democratic process.

            Embracing these opportunities will rely on governments playing a central role in the design, development and deployment of technology that serves the public good. It will require investment in entrepreneurial government digital capacity, co-operation on technology and its governance with our friends and allies, and recognition that wealth and power do not confer legitimacy to decisions made in a boardroom.</p>
<h1 style="color: blue;">"AI is back in the limelight as the technology most in need of scrutiny, attention and investment"</h1>
<p>The latest technology to capture the attention of venture capitalists and headline writers is generative AI, best understood as software that looks for patterns in images or text or music and regurgitates plausible variations. These remarkable magic tricks have eclipsed cryptocurrencies and the metaverse, thrusting AI back into the limelight as the technology most in need of scrutiny, attention and investment.

    Technology is transformative. The way we work, shop and understand the world around us has been reshaped by digital technology and the companies that profit from its design. AI has been part of that transformation for 20 years.
    
    Heading out without Google Maps or Citymapper in your pocket is brave. Ignoring your credit score is foolish. Running for office without targeted advertising and predictive electoral models is impossible.</p>
