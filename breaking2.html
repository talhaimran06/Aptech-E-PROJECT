          <p class="card-text">He held up a Brentford shirt printed with the words "For you Uncle Brian" after celebrating with teammates and Brentford staff on the touchline.

            The goal cancelled out Forest midfielder Danilo's third-minute volley, with Brentford eventually winning 3-2 after second-half goals from Ben Mee and Neal Maupay.
            
            It came 260 days after Toney's last Premier League appearance, against Liverpool in May last year.

            <p>Toney was handed an eight-month ban and fined Â£50,000 after admitting 232 breaches of FA betting rules between February 2017 and January 2021.

                He had been allowed to train with team-mates since September, and earlier this month scored a hat-trick while playing for Brentford's B team against Southampton under-23s,
                
                Initially, Toney was charged with 262 breaches of FA rule E8, but the FA subsequently withdrew 30 of these breaches.</p>
          <p>The ban means he will miss Brentford's final two games of the season - Saturday's game at Tottenham and at home to Manchester City on the final day.

            In a statement, Toney said: "Today I have received notification of my eight-month ban from football following a hearing before an FA Regulatory Commission that took place yesterday.
            
            "I am naturally disappointed that I will be unable to play for the next eight months.
            
            "The written reasons for the commission's decision have not yet been published, so I make no further comment at this point other than to thank my family and friends, Brentford FC and our fans for their continued support, through what has been a very difficult time.
            
            "I now focus on returning to play the game I love next season."</p>
