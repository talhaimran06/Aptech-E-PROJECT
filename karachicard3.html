                      <p> At least 25 people were arrested on Sunday after PTI workers and police clashed  <br>in Karachi’s Teen Talwar during an election rally. </p>

         <p>According to police, the PTI did not obtain prior permission for holding a rally in the Red Zone, while the party said it was being deprived of its constitutional right to campaign.
            The development came as the leaders of all major political parties — <br> including the PPP, the PML-N and the JamiatUlema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) — continued with their election campaigns in the country.

        <p>The PTI workers showed resistance and allegedly pelted stones at the policemen, resulting in injuries to some policemen. Later, police called reinforcements who resorted to tear gas shelling <br> and baton-charge to disperse the workers, they added</p>

<p>“It has been a frustrating and upsetting period for Jofra Archer,” Rob Key, managing director for England men’s cricket, said. “He was making good progress until a recurrence of the elbow injury, which kept him out for an extended period previously

    <p>South Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG) South Asad Raza said that “the PTI held a political rally in the Red Zone <br> without seeking a no-objection certificate from SSP or DC South”.</p>

   <p>“When they (the political workers) were stopped, they resorted to violence and pelted stones at police. As a result, Boat Basin SHO RiazNiazi and several others were injured and shifted to a hospital,” he said.
    “Police have arrested 25 persons and a first information report is being registered against them,” he said. The DIG admitted that the police were compelled to take action against the rally because the participants had blocked the main road in Clifton

    <p>Further, Karachi Additional IG Khadim Hussain Rind took notice of reports alleging media personnel were also mistreated by police and ordered an inquiry against those responsible, according to the Karachi police spokesperson.
        The South DIG also took notice of the “undesirable attitude” <br> against media personnel and declared that such attitude would not be tolerated.
        “After determining who is responsible for torturing the media persons, legal action <br> would be taken against the responsible policemen,” the spokesperson said.
