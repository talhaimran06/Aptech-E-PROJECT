         <p>: Members of the UK House of Commons are likely to vote on Wednesday on an amendment brought by the Scottish National Party on an immediate  <br>ceasefire and halt to fighting in Gaza.</p>
         <br>
         <p>The motion was moved last week by the Scottish National Party, which said it intends to seek a vote calling on the UK government to “join the international community in urgently pressing all parties to agree to an immediate ceasefire”.</p>
<p>“I think all just people around the world, not just in Britain, must stand up and call for this madness (to end),” Ismail Patel, chairman of the Friends of Al Aqsa campaign, said.
    In New York City, thousands rallied to show solidarity with Palestinians <br> and draw attention to Israeli airstrikes in Gaza. Demonstrations occurred in various city neighbourhoods <br> on Friday, where participants echoed the call <br> for “Free Palestine” and an end to Israel’s unlawful occupation of Palestinian territories.

    <p>Last week, SNP Westminster leader Stephen Flynn said Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer “cannot just sit on their hands” while “collective punishment” takes place.
        A second amendment calling for a ceasefire has been tabled by a Labour backbencher. House of Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle will decide if the amendments are selected for consideration, which would then lead to a vote.
