          <p class="card-text"> New York’s Top Court Just Narrowed the Case That Spelled Doom for Bloomberg’s Soda Ban </p>
         <p>A DECISION from New York’s top court last month weakens one of the most powerful tools used to fight state <br> regulations on topics from promoting vaccines to discouraging tobacco and soda consumption.
            </p>
         <br>
         <p>In a case known as Matter of Stevens, the Court of Appeals ruled that in limited circumstances, law enforcement can search a dna database to investigate a crime if they get permission from the state Commission on Forensic Services. Though prosecutors cheered the ruling and civil rights groups criticized it, its direct impact is likely limited, as the database  <br>is only used a handful of times a year.
            </p>
<p>But the reasoning upon which the ruling relied could have a much greater impact. The decision by the court’s new chief judge, Rowan Wilson, narrows the scope of a landmark Court of Appeals ruling under which  <br>judges have overturned state regulations for nearly 40 years

    <p>“I think all just people around the world, not just in Britain, must stand up  <br>and call for this madness (to end),” Ismail Patel, chairman of the Friends of Al Aqsa campaign, said.
        In New York City, thousands rallied to <br> show solidarity with Palestinians and draw attention to Israeli airstrikes in Gaza. Demonstrations occurred in various city neighbourhoods on Friday, where participants echoed the call for “Free Palestine” and an end to Israel’s unlawful occupation of Palestinian territories.

        <p>During the meeting, PM Kakar said the government was taking “every possible step” for the provision of medicines to the common man at a suitable price.
            He added that the government was devising policies that would not only  <br>benefit the common man but also the pharmaceutical industry.
