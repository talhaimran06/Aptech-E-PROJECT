            <p>M​oderate shaking was felt in Southern California, including Los Angeles, as an earthquake shook the region late Friday morning local time.

                A​ccording to the U.S. Geological Survey, the tremor measured a preliminary 4.2 magnitude when it struck at 10:55 a.m. local time (1:55 p.m. EST) Friday. The epicenter was located just northwest of Lytle Creek, California, and struck at a shallow depth of about five miles.
                
                The quake occurred in Cajon Pass, where the San Andreas and San Jacinto faults come <br> together, veteran seismologist Lucy Jones said in a social media post. In 1970, there was a magnitude 5.2 quake with a 4.0 foreshock close to the same location, she said.

                T​he quake struck in the San Gabriel Mountains in an area about 45 miles east of Los Angeles.
                
                F​ire departments in both Los Angeles and San Bernardino County to the east of the city said ther <br>e were no immediate reports of serious damage or injuries.</p>
        
                <p>Cari Torguson, a bartender at Melody’s Place in Lytle Creek, said she felt “a hard boom and a shake” from the earthquake.

                    “It wasn’t very long but it was scary,” she told the Associated Press.
                    
                    A decorative glass mushroom on a shelf above the bar fell and broke, and a jar of instant coffee toppled off a shelf in the adjoining store, she said.
                    
                    There were only a handful of people inside the building and no one had time to duck under a table, she said.
                    
                    The earthquake warning system called ShakeAlert initially estimated the magnitude above 4.5, so alerts were sent to cellphones, the USGS said in a social media post.
                    
                    The system is designed to detect a quake and almost instantly send alerts to areas where significant shaking is expected to arrive, giving people time <br> to protect themselves, or slow down trains and buses.
