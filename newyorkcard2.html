          <h1>Why Your Energy Bills Are Going Up</h1>
          <img src="./Untitled-design-11.jpg" class="card-img-top" alt="..." style="width: 900px;">
          <p class="card-text"> IF YOU LIVE IN New York City, get ready for a big electric bill this month. Behind the spike is a  <br>little-known, deeply bureaucratic process: Meet the “rate case.</p>
         <p>It’s a long, winding, technical ordeal, structured in many ways like a court case, that dictates how much New Yorkers pay for some of the most basic daily <br> necessities: energy and water. And it’s hardly restricted to New York City. Utilities throughout the state apply for rate hikes in a constant cycle, <br> and regulators almost always approve them in some modified form.</p>
         <br>
         <p>In late July, a state body called the Public Service Commission (psc) approved major rate hikes for Con Edison customers over <br> the next three years, starting with a roughly 9 percent electric bill increase for the rest of 2023. The average residential customer getting both gas and electricity <br> from ConEd can expect to pay about $65 more per month by early 2025
            </p>
<p>
    That was the culmination of 18 months of haggling between regulators, local officials, and business and advocacy groups. It was only supposed to take 11 months — and because it went overtime, hikes that were supposed to be spread out over an entire year get crunched into a few months.
    More hikes are coming: Three of New York’s major utilities  <br>— serving electricity and gas from western New York to the eastern tip of Long Island — have rate cases underway right now.
    In central New York, a proposed deal could see electric delivery rates increase more than 50 percent by mid-2025. <br> And the two most recent cases have floated the steepest hikes yet: A Hudson Valley utility and the main downstate gas utility are both requesting an additional $30 per month, on average, for the energy they sell.
