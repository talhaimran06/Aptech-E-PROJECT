<p>The apex court had hours earlier ordered the electoral watchdog to announce the election schedule by tonight after it suspended a Lahore High Court order that had stayed the appointment of returning officers and district returning officers from the bureaucracy.</p>
    <p>“I think all just people around the world, not just in Britain, must stand up  <br>and call for this madness (to end),” Ismail Patel, chairman of the Friends of Al Aqsa campaign, said.
        In New York City, thousands rallied to <br> show solidarity with Palestinians and draw attention to Israeli airstrikes in Gaza. Demonstrations occurred in various city neighbourhoods on Friday, where participants echoed the call for “Free Palestine” and an end to Israel’s unlawful occupation of Palestinian territories.
