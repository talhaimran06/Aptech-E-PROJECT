          <h1>Hundreds of homes have been devastated by flooding in England following a powerful storm and a week of heavy rainfall.</h1>
          <p class="card-text"></p>
          There are more than 230 flood warnings in force, the majority in the Midlands, East Anglia and southern England, with many residents forced to evacuate their properties.

          Flooded roads and railway tracks are bringing more delays for travellers.
          
          A major incident has been declared in Nottinghamshire around the River Trent.
          <br>
          Many living close to the river have had their homes and businesses ruined, while major roads have been cut off in some areas with emergency services reporting difficulties in attending incidents.
          
          The Environment Agency said the Trent's levels were some of the highest seen in 24 years.
          
          It peaked at 5.35m, just shy of the record set in 2000, when the river reached 5.5m in height.

          <p>"Over November and December, following Storm Babet and Storm Ciaran, the ground was incredibly saturated right across the country, particularly in the east," Ms Douglass said.

            "That's been topped up over the pre-Christmas period [and] that rainfall from this week has just added to that, so there's nowhere for the water to go."
            
            The past week saw parts of the UK affected by Storm Henk, which was the eighth named storm in three months, although the current spell of wet and windy weather is set to  <br>be replaced by cooler and drier conditions.
            
            The UK Health Security Agency has issued a cold weather alert for the coming days and warned that temperatures are set to plummet. The yellow cold weather alert for all of England comes into force  <br>at 09:00 GMT on Saturday and expires at noon on 12 January.</p>
<br>

<p>Earlier on Friday, Nottinghamshire County Council said more than 100 homes in the county  <br>were among those hit by flooding, but warned the number could rise.

    Around 50 people were led to safety by firefighters overnight after a canal burst its banks in Hackney Wick, east London, causing flooding in an area of around 10 acres.
    
    A party boat moored at Temple Pier on the River Thames sank on Thursday during heavy rainfall.
    
    In Bath, the famous Pulteney Weir on the River Avon has been completely submerged. One Pulteney  <br>Bridge shop owner told the BBC he has "never seen it so high".</p>
