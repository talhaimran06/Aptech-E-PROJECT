          <h1>Nato to set up liaison office in Tokyo</h1>
          <img src="./prime_minister_kishida_fumio_01.jpeg" class="card-img-top" alt="..." style="width: 900px;">
          <p class="card-text">TOKYO: Nato will set up a liaison office in Tokyo in 2024 and use it as a hub for co-operation with Australia, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea, the Nikkei newspaper said on  <br>Tuesday, a plan China has described as unwelcome</p>
         
         <br>
        <p>In May, Japan’s ambassador to the United States said the US-led military alliance was planning a Tokyo office, the first in Asia, to ease regional consultations, but French President  <br>Emmanuel Macron objected to the plan.</p>
        <p>At the time, China said the Asia-Pacific did not welcome what it called “group confrontation”, urging Japan to be “extra cautious on the issue of military security” given its “history of aggression”.
            The Nikkei said Nato would deepen ties with  <br>its four major partners in the Pacific, preparing two-way cooperation documents with each, to form a basis for collaboration on issues such as cybersecurity and space.

<p>And at least three New York nonprofit organizations are calling on donors <br> to help outfit those settlers with combat gear, <br> in a fundraising blitz funneling millions of tax-deductible dollars to the West Bank aggression
    By chipping into a “thermal drone matching campaign,” donors can help the Long Island- <br>based One Israel Fund buy remote-controlled aerial vehicles for settler militias. With a contribution to the American Friends of AteretCohanim’s “security projects,” they can equip settlers with accessories for their guns and tools to keep an eye on “Arab thugs” in occupied East Jerusalem. Donating to the Brooklyn-based Hebron Fund’s “Israel Is Under Attack” campaign helps expand one of Israel’s most extensive local surveillance networks. If New Yorkers contribute by the end of the year, they can write it off on their 2023 tax returns.
