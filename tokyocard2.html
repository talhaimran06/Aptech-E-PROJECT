        <p>>CAMP DAVID: US President Joe Biden and the leaders of Japan and South Korea said they saw <br> a “new chapter” with greater three-way security cooperation as they met for a first-of-a-kind summit</p>
         <br>
        <p>Going tieless in the Camp David presidential retreat, Biden praised the “political courage” of South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol and Japanese Prime Minister <br> Fumio Kishida in turning the page on historical animosity</p>

<p>“Our countries are stronger — and the world will be safer — as we stand together. I know that’s a belief that we <br> all three share,” he told them as he opened the talks.</p>
    <p>Biden said the three would pursue “this new era of cooperation and renew our resolve to serve as  <br>a force of good across the Indo-Pacific and, quite frankly, around the world.”</p>
        <p>And at least three New York nonprofit organizations are calling on donors to help outfit those settlers with combat gear, <br> in a fundraising blitz funneling millions of tax-deductible dollars to the West Bank aggression
            By chipping into a “thermal drone matching campaign,” donors can help the Long Island- <br>based One Israel Fund buy remote-controlled aerial vehicles for settler militias. With a contribution to the American Friends of AteretCohanim’s “security projects,” they can equip settlers with accessories for their guns and tools to keep an eye on “Arab thugs” in occupied East Jerusalem. Donating to the Brooklyn-based Hebron Fund’s “Israel Is Under Attack” campaign helps expand one of Israel’s most extensive local surveillance networks. If New Yorkers contribute by the end of the year, they can write it off on their 2023 tax returns.
