          <h1>New York Charities Send Combat Gear to West Bank Settlements</h1>

          <p class="card-text"> Israeli settlers have unleashed a wave of violence on Palestinians. With tax-deductible donations, New Yorkers can help equip them to carry it out.</p>
         <p>VIGILANTE VIOLENCE is at an all-time high in the occupied West Bank. Emboldened by the war in the Gaza Strip and backed by the military, Israeli settlers aiming to annex more and more of the Palestinian
            territory have launched hundreds of attacks, displacing people <br> from at least 17 communities over the past month while soldiers and settlers have killed nearly 200.
            
            </p>
         <br>
        <p>And at least three New York nonprofit organizations are calling on donors to help outfit those settlers with combat gear, <br> in a fundraising blitz funneling millions of tax-deductible dollars to the West Bank aggression
            By chipping into a “thermal drone matching campaign,” donors can help the Long Island- <br>based One Israel Fund buy remote-controlled aerial vehicles for settler militias. With a contribution to the American Friends of AteretCohanim’s “security projects,” they can equip settlers with accessories for their guns and tools to keep an eye on “Arab thugs” in occupied East Jerusalem. Donating to the Brooklyn-based Hebron Fund’s “Israel Is Under Attack” campaign helps expand one of Israel’s most extensive local surveillance networks. If New Yorkers contribute by the end of the year, they can write it off on their 2023 tax returns.
