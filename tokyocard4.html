          <h1>IPEF’s politics without rewards</h1>
          <img src="./434643.jpg" class="card-img-top" alt="..." style="width: 900px;">
          <p class="card-text">Pakistan’s policymakers and media have mostly overlooked developments around the new US-led Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF) initiative.</p>
         <p>This indifference appears to have stemmed from the fact that Islamabad is not part of the 14-nation pact announced last year in Tokyo in spite of Pakistan being one of the 40 economies falling in the Indo-Pacific region. Another possible explanation, as elaborated by Manzoor Ahmed, who has served as Pakistan’s ambassador to the World Trade Organisation <br> in Geneva, relates to Islamabad’s utter lack of 
            
            </p>
         <br>
       <p>enthusiasm to join any major, meaningful multilateral trade and economic alliance.
        Most commentators from IPEF countries believe that the <br> initiative is part of American efforts to reclaim its influence in the fast-growing Pacific and Southeast Asian regions and ‘decouple’ China from these economies.
        </p>

<p>IPEF comes five years after Washington ditched the much wider Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), now known as the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), out of concern that the free trade deal would lead to an influx of cheaper goods and hurt American businesses and jobs.</p>
    <p>And at least three New York nonprofit organizations are calling on donors to help outfit those settlers with combat gear, <br> in a fundraising blitz funneling millions of tax-deductible dollars to the West Bank aggression
        By chipping into a “thermal drone matching campaign,” donors can help the Long Island- <br>based One Israel Fund buy remote-controlled aerial vehicles for settler militias. With a contribution to the American Friends of AteretCohanim’s “security projects,” they can equip settlers with accessories for their guns and tools to keep an eye on “Arab thugs” in occupied East Jerusalem. Donating to the Brooklyn-based Hebron Fund’s “Israel Is Under Attack” campaign helps expand one of Israel’s most extensive local surveillance networks. If New Yorkers contribute by the end of the year, they can write it off on their 2023 tax returns.
